## Manifold learning uncovers nonlinear interactions between the adolescent brain and environment that predict emotional and behavioral problems

## Analysis Scripts
This directory contains all analysis scripts used for embeddings, benchmarking, and predictions in the above manuscript. It also includes code for selecting participants and plotting results and running statistics. 
The script `run_exogenous_phate.py` is how we ran the E-PHATE embeddings for the analyses reported inthis paper; since then, we have released [EPHATE](https://github.com/ericabusch/EPHATE) as a standalone package and have shown that it replicates
the embeddings presented here.

For more information, check out our [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2024.07.001), now out in Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging.
